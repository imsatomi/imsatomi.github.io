Hi. Iâ€™m a master's student at the [Ishiguro Lab](https://ishiguro-lab.org) in [Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/academics/grad_interdisciplinary.html) at [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

<!-- My research interests include information visualization, interactive data analysis, and human-computer interaction. I am currently working on developing interactive methods and a visual analytics system to assist users in the analysis of high-dimensional data, with a particular emphasis on enabling interactive non-linear dimensionality reduction. -->

My research interests include where VR (Virtual Reality), HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), and interactive sports instruction come together. My goal is to improve sports education by taking advantage of the latest technologies. 
Recently, I have looked into techniques for interactive body movement learning using drones and VR. 
My particular interest is to develop immersive and productive learning experiences.

I received my B.S. at the [Takeda Lab](https://takedalab.g.sp.m.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp) in [Department of Electrical Engineering, Electronics, and Information Engineering](http://www.nuee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/index.html) from [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp) in 2023.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
