Hi. Iâ€™m a master's student at the [Ishiguro Lab](https://ishiguro-lab.org) in [Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/academics/grad_interdisciplinary.html) at [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

My research interests include where VR (Virtual Reality), HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), and interactive sports instruction come together. My goal is to improve sports education by taking advantage of the latest technologies. 
Recently, I have looked into techniques for interactive body movement learning using drones and VR. 
My particular interest is to develop immersive and productive learning experiences.

I received my B.S. at the [Takeda Lab](https://takedalab.g.sp.m.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp) in [Department of Electrical Engineering, Electronics, and Information Engineering](http://www.nuee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/index.html) from [Nagoya University](https://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp) in 2023.
